# jquery-biblio
Plugin to extract biblios from Wiki type pages with Harvard style references.


This is one of the usablity features from my site.   Please look at the static demo to see the concept, the CSS is abit sparse.
This module is properly documented at http://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/jQuery-biblio

This doesn't pollute anything into the global namespace, but only one instance may be made per page.  As noted elsewhere, this applies to the page, an ignores the current selected elements.
Files in 3rdparty are purely to run the tests, and should not be installed to any servers.

This is now pretty much the second edition, it will download extra link data depending on settings.
I should mention CORS.
