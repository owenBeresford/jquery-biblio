# jquery-biblio
Plugin to extract biblios from Wiki type pages with Harvard style references.


This is one of the usablity features from my site.   Please look at the static demo to see the concept, the CSS is abit sparse.
This module is properly documented a http://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/jquery-biblio

This doesn't pollute anything into the global namespace, but only one instance may be made per page.
